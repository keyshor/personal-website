### Other Projects

#### Internships

* __Applied Scientist Internship at Amazon Web Services, AI Labs (Summer 2022).__
    I worked on a project on incorporating execution semantics during training of large language models for
    code generation. I explored different models for code generation that
    also predict traces obtained by running the generated code on various inputs.
    The trace prediction task is added as an auxiliary objective during training
    in order to improve semantic understanding of code by the model.

* __Research Internship at Nokia Bell Labs (Summer 2020).__
    I explored applications of deep reinforcement learning and imitation learning in solving
    classical regenerative stopping problems and studied the effectiveness of machine learning based
    solutions for logistics optimization.

* __Software Development Engineer Internship at Amazon Web Services, Automated Reasoning Group (Summer 2019).__
    I worked on automatically discovering sinks of sensitive data in Java code. Functions known as sinks are usually given as inputs to a taint analysis tool to check for
    security vulnerabilities in code. New techniques are needed to find such sinks since manual examination of code is close to impossible in large codebases.  My project was on applying machine learning to identify sinks in
    the codebase of AWS storage services.

#### Graduate Course Projects

*  __PennCloud: Course Project for Software Systems (CIS 505).__
    Built a cloud system with e-mail and storage services in a team of 4. I was responsible for designing and implementing a distributed key-value storage based on Google BigTable that is sequentially consistent, fault tolerant and scalable.  

* __Online learning with many experts: Course Project for Computational Learning Theory (CIS 625).__
    Survey of online learning methods for dealing with too many (potentially infinite) experts.  
    [[report](http://cis.upenn.edu/~castan/doc/2018/No%20Regret%20Learning%20Report.pdf)]

* __Testing non-interference with KLEE: Course Project for Software Analysis and Testing (CIS 700).__
    Used symbolic execution tool KLEE to test non-interference properties.
