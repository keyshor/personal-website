### Other Projects

* __SDE Internship at Amazon Web Services.__
    I worked as an intern in the [Automated Reasoning Group](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/tag/automated-reasoning/)
    at AWS during the summer of 2019 on automatically discovering sinks of sensitive data in Java code. Functions known as sinks are usually given as inputs to a taint analysis tool to check for
    security vulnerabilities in code. New techniques are needed to find such sinks since manual examination of code is close to impossible in large codebases.  My project was on using machine learning to identify sinks in
    the codebase of AWS storage services.

#### Graduate Course Projects

*  __PennCloud: Course Project for Software Systems (CIS 505).__
    Built a cloud system with e-mail and storage services in a team of 4. I was responsible for the distributed backend key-value store based on Google BigTable that is sequentially consistent, fault tolerant and scalable.  

* __Online learning with many experts: Course Project for Computational Learning Theory (CIS 625).__
    Survey of online learning methods for dealing with too many (potentially infinite) experts.  
    [[report](http://cis.upenn.edu/~castan/doc/2018/No%20Regret%20Learning%20Report.pdf)]

* __Testing non-interference with KLEE: Course Project for Software Analysis and Testing (CIS 700).__
    Used symbolic execution tool KLEE to test non-interference properties.
