Hi! I am a final-year PhD student in Computer and Information Science being advised by Prof. [Rajeev Alur](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~alur). My research interests lie at the intersection of Formal Methods and Machine Learning. In particular, I am interested in applying formal methods to improve applicability and reliability of reinforcement learning, verifying systems with neural network components and using neurosymbolic approaches to improve program synthesis and analysis.

__I am on the (academic and industry) job market this year!__
