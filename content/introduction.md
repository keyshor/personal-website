I am a third-year PhD student in computer science at the University of Pennsylvania.
I am being advised by [Rajeev Alur](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~alur). I received my
B.Sc. (Honors) in Mathematics and Computer Science from the
[Chennai Mathematical Institute](https://www.cmi.ac.in).

My (broad) research areas of interest include formal methods, verification, programming languages
and machine learning. In particular, I am interested in applying formal methods to
improve applicability and reliability of deep reinforcement learning methods,
verifying systems with machine learning components and using machine learning to
improve scalability of program analysis and verification techniques.
