<li><p><strong>Formal Methods for Reinforcement Learning.</strong>
Reinforcement learning is a promising approach for learning control policies for robot tasks. This project focusses on applying techniques from logic and formal methods to enhance reinforcement learning. For example, how to compile formal logical specifications to reward functions so that one can use existing RL algorithms to learn policies for such specifications? How to use state abstractions for hierarchical reinforcement learning? How to verify/test learned policies for safety properties?</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Streaming Algorithms over Probabilistic Streams.</strong>
In streaming algorithms, streams are defined to be sequences of data points. In this project, we consider probabilistic streams which are sequences of distributions over a finite set of events. We analyze space complexity of streaming computation in this setting for different query classes.</p></li>
