      <description>I am a fifth-year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania. I am being advised by Rajeev Alur. I received my B.Sc. (Honors) in Mathematics and Computer Science from Chennai Mathematical Institute.
My (broad) areas of interest include formal methods, verification, and machine learning. In particular, I am interested in applying formal methods to improve applicability and reliability of deep reinforcement learning, verifying systems with neural network components, and using machine learning to improve scalability of program analysis and verification.</description>

      <description>Other Projects Internships Research Internship at Nokia Bell Labs (Summer 2020). I explored applications of deep reinforcement learning and imitation learning in solving classical regenerative stopping problems and studied the effectiveness of machine learning based solutions for logistics optimization.
SDE Internship at Amazon Web Services (Summer 2019). I interned with the Automated Reasoning Group at AWS. I worked on automatically discovering sinks of sensitive data in Java code. Functions known as sinks are usually given as inputs to a taint analysis tool to check for security vulnerabilities in code.</description>
