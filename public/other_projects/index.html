			<ul>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Research Internship at Nokia Bell Labs (Summer 2020).</strong>
						I worked on applications of deep reinforcement learning and imitation learning to
						classical regenerative stopping problems and studied the effectiveness of learning based
						solutions in logistics optimization.</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<p><strong>SDE Internship at Amazon Web Services (Summer 2019).</strong>
						I interned with the <a
							href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/tag/automated-reasoning/">Automated Reasoning
							Group</a>
						at AWS. I worked on automatically discovering sinks of sensitive data in Java code. Functions
						known as sinks are usually given as inputs to a taint analysis tool to check for
						security vulnerabilities in code. New techniques are needed to find such sinks since manual
						examination of code is close to impossible in large codebases. My project was on applying
						machine learning to identify sinks in
						the codebase of AWS storage services.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h4 id="graduate-course-projects">Graduate Course Projects</h4>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<p><strong>PennCloud: Course Project for Software Systems (CIS 505).</strong>
						Built a cloud system with e-mail and storage services in a team of 4. I was responsible for the
						backend distributed key-value storage based on Google BigTable that is sequentially consistent,
						fault tolerant and scalable.</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<p><strong>Online learning with many experts: Course Project for Computational Learning Theory (CIS
							625).</strong>
						Survey of online learning methods for dealing with too many (potentially infinite)
						experts.<br />
						[<a href="http://cis.upenn.edu/~castan/doc/2018/No%20Regret%20Learning%20Report.pdf">report</a>]
					</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<p><strong>Testing non-interference with KLEE: Course Project for Software Analysis and Testing (CIS
							700).</strong>
						Used symbolic execution tool KLEE to test non-interference properties.<br />
						[<a href="https://github.com/concolism/concolic-testing">code</a>]</p>
